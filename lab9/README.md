#### Strategy

#### Functional
By implementing sorting strategies as lambda functions, the classes could be removed

I know the sorting functions could be implementing using streams such as in these examples:  
Quicksort: https://gist.github.com/chainone/b7f41152db5d711e110e1c73a4019ae8 . 
Mergesort:http://www.programmingopiethehokie.com/2014/07/java-7-forkjoin-and-java-8-streams.html . 

The functional versions are more concise.
